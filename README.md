# Bulk Synthetic Data Editor

This is a tool that i have built to help me with fine-tuning LLMs. It is a tool that allows me to import JSONL data from a file, generate synthetic data using AI, check for similarity between pairs of messages, and export data to a file.

## Usage

1. clone the repository
2. set up a .env file with the VITE_API_GATEWAY (vercel gateway API key)
3. run `pnpm install`
4. run `pnpm run dev`
5. enjoy!
